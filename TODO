Tasks
- Fix the way the delete & cancel columns resize everything... they should just attach to the end. 
- It's probably not to early to implement an account system with roles. We'll need it eventually so that not just anyone can edit anything. Only superadmins should be able to directly edit players, e.g.
- Do we need the notion of an "account" or can we glob all of that into the Player model? In principle there could be a user of the app that doesn't play in the league, and it might be cleaner regardless to just have things like the login state, role, and so forth stored independently.
- Create a landing page with login, & then brief explanation of all the components.
- Fix the (currently horrific) design of the navigation. I'm thinking a sidebar is smarter but didn't want to mess with it.
- Have the new player ID default to whatever is the next available ID.
- Implement team data model & link to the player
- Add column in player list to ID their team. Clicking on the team number should jump to the team page for that team
- Implement player detail page that shows detailed win/loss record, matches played (per season), rank chart over time, etc.

Ideas
- ? Colorize the player row background based on value of isActive?
- ? Make the Delete & Edit columns look different, e.g. by color of text/icon or bg? Since they're "active" i think it makes sense to distinguish them.
